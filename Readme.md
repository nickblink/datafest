DataFest Repository

Nick's addition
----------
Go to the 2020 page and then versioning control or whatever it's called. That has a good intro to github/gitkraken.

DataFest
----------

DataFest is a two-day workshop held during J-term and developed by
data practitioners and researchers from across the university. Hosted
by the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, the purpose
of the workshop is for participants to develop skills in working with
data. It is structured around the data lifecycle, includes lectures
and hands-on sessions focused on data concepts, project planning and
data science workflows, processing and analysis, and finally data
dissemination. It is offered to faculty, post-doctorates, graduate and
undergraduate students, and staff at Harvard University.
